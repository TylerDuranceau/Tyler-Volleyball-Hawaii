    <p>
      I grew up in Hawaii, where volleyball is a big part of the culture. 
      Playing the sport has taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. 
      It has also given me some of my closest friendships.

      Hawaii’s beaches and volleyball courts shaped a lot of my life. 
      The balance between school, practice, and games has helped me grow 
      not just as an athlete but as a person.
